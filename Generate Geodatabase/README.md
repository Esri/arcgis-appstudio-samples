## Take a feature service offline by generating a geodatabase.

This sample demonstrates the following:
- How to take a feature service offline by generating a geodatabase.
- Pan and zoom into the desired area, making sure the area you want to take offline is within the red rectangle. 
- Tap on the Generate Geodatabase button, and this will call generateGeodatabase, which will return a job. The job must be started manually, and once started can be canceled at anytime. 
- Once the job completes successfully, feature layers are created with the output feature tables (which are obtained from the result geodatabase), and the layers are added to the map.
