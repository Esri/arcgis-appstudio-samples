## Migration tool for Version 1.0 of AppStudio

This is a migration tool for those that have invested time and effort in beta versions of the Map Tour. With the final release of AppStudio version 1.0, a runtime import (Runtime.Dialogs) is no longer available. This tool will search all your Map tours and update them so they continue to work. This will only work on apps that have not had folder structure and file name changes.
