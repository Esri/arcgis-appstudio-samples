## Calculate route between two locations

This sample demonstrates the following:
- For simplicity, the sample comes loaded with a start and end stop. 
- You can tap on the route button to get a route between these stops. Once the route is generated, the directions button gets enabled. 
- Tap on the button to see the step by step directions for the route.
- The sample uses the generateDefaultParameters method on RouteTask to get the default parameters from the service.
