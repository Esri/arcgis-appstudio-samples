## Service Area

This sample demonstrates how to find service areas around a point using the ServiceTask. Barriers can also be added which can affect the impedance by not letting traffic through or adding the time is takes to pass that barrier.

To display a service around a certain location:

1. Create a ServiceAreaTask from an online service.
2. Get a ServiceAreaParameter from the task using ServiceAreaTask.createDefaultParameters.
3. Set a spatial reference for the parameters using ServiceAreaParameters.outputSpatialReference. This will allow any geometry that is returned to be displayed on the Mapview.
4. Set the parameters to return polygons, which will return any service area that needs to be displayed.
5. Add a ServiceAreaFacility to parameters, ServiceAreaParameters.setFacilities
6. Optionally add PolylineBarriers to parameters, ServiceAreaParameters.setPolylineBarriers.
7. Get the ServiceAreaResult by solving the service area task using the parameters, ServiceAreaTask::solveServiceArea.
8. Get any ServiceAreaPolygons that were returned using ServiceAreaResult.resultPolygons.
9. Facility Index is the facility from the MapView that you want to get the service area of.
10. Display service areas to MapView by creating graphics for their geometry and adding to graphics overlay.
