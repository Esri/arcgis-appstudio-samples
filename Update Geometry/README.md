## Update Geometry

The sample demonstrates how to update geometry of a feature in a feature service.

Selecting a feature on the map highlights the feature. Selecting another location on the map moves the feature to the new location. This is done by first obtaining the feature after it is selected. Once the feature is obtained, the feature's geometry is updated by setting the geometry to the new map point. To update the feature in the feature table, call updateFeature and pass in the edited feature. Finally, to update the feature in the service, call applyEdits.
