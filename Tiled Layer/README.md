## Tiled Layer

This sample demonstrates how to use a Vector Tiled Layer and ArcGIS Tiled Layer

There are two samples in this item:
- Vector Tiled Layer: When a new item is selected from the combo box, a JavaScript function that determines the currently selected vector tiled layer basemap is executed. The map's basemap is replaced by setting basemap property to the desired basemap. If there were operational layers present in the map, this would have no effect on them.method is called to apply the edits to the service, deleting the feature from the service.
- ArcGIS Tiled Layer: This sample demonstrates how to display a tiled map service. An ArcGISTiledLayer is created by setting its url property to the URL of the map service endpoint. The ArcGISTiledLayer is nested within a basemap, thus becoming one of the basemap's layers. The basemap is set as the basemap of the map, and the map is set as the map for the map view. Note how default properties in QML make this nesting easier to code.
