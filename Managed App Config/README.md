## Managed App Config

This sample app demonstrates how to use AppFramework.Management plugin -ManagedAppConfiguration QML type to allow Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) software to overwrite certain provided default settings. Currently, managed app configuration is only supported on iOS and Android platforms.

In this sample app, the default portal URL is ‚Äúwww.arcgis.com‚Äù and the default portal name is ‚ÄúArcGIS‚Äù. You can upload the app installation file into the EMM software and set the preferred portal URL and name values. The portal URL and name set in the EMM will be shown in the Settings portalURL and Settings portalName field in the sample app. You can see what happens when changing values in EMM software in Settings JSON field.

To use this feature, you will need to:

Step 1:  Include restriction .xml file for Android and configuration schema .xml file for iOS in your app project folder. In this sample app, the restriction file is "restrictions.xml" and the configuration schema file is "specfile.xml".

Step 2: Include the management property into the appinfo.json file. You can go to the appinfo.json file, line 82 to check how we add the management property.   

Step 3: Use ManagedAppConfiguration QML type to read policy settings in AppStudio app.

Step 4: Upload the app to your EMM software and follow the steps provided by your EMM software to setup managed app configuration using key-value pairs.
