## Unique Value Renderer

This sample demonstrates how to use a UniqueValueRenderer to style different Features in a FeatureLayer with different Symbols.

First a ServiceFeatureTable and a FeatureLayer are constructed and added to the Map. Then a UniqueValueRenderer is created, and the fieldName to be used as the renderer field is set as ("STATE_ABBR"). You can use multiple fields; this sample only uses one. Multiple SimpleFillSymbols are defined for each type of feature we want to render differently (in this case different states of the USA). SimpleFillSymbols can be applied to polygon features; these are the types of features found in the feature service used for this ServiceFeatureTable. A default symbol is also created; this will be used for all other features that do not match the all of the UniqueValues defined. Separate UniqueValues objects are created which define the values in the renderer field and what symbol should be used for matching features. These are added to the UniqueValue list. The renderer is set on the layer and is rendered in the MapView accordingly.
