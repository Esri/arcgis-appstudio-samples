## Graphic Overlay (2D & 3D)

This item has following five samples:
- Identify Graphics: This sample demonstrates how to identify graphics in a graphics overlay. When you select a graphic on the map, a message box appears.
- Add Graphics With Renderers: This sample demonstrates how to add graphics and set renderer on graphic overlays.
- Add Graphics With Symbols: This sample demonstrates how to add graphics with symbols to a graphics overlay.
- Graphic Overlay: This sample demonstrates applying a dictionary renderer to graphics to display military symbology. This sample loads a number of point, line, and polygon military elements from an XML file and adds them as graphics to a GraphicsOverlay. A DictionaryRenderer is applied to the GraphicsOverlay in order to display the graphics with MIL-STD-2525D military symbology. When all graphics are created, the map's viewpoint is set to zoom to the full extent of all graphics.
- Graphic Overlay 3D: This sample demonstrates applying a dictionary renderer to a graphics overlay in a 3D scene to display military symbology. The sample loads a number of point military elements from an XML file and adds them as graphics to a GraphicsOverlay. A DictionaryRenderer is applied to the GraphicsOverlay in order to display the graphics with MIL-STD-2525D military symbology.
