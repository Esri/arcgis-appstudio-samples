## Map Viewpoint

This sample demonstrates how to set initial map location, initial map area, change viewpoint, and manage bookmarks

There are 4 samples in this item:
- Set initial map location: This sample demonstrates how to create a map with a predefined initial extent. A ViewpointExtent is declared with an Envelope, and is applied to the map by setting this value to the map's initialViewpoint property.
- Set initial map area: This is one of the most basic samples for the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt. It shows how to construct a map by passing in a basemap type, a latitude and longitude, and a scale.
- Change viewpoint: The map view has several methods for setting its current viewpoint. Select a viewpoint from the UI to see the viewpoint changed using one of these methods.
- Manage bookmarks: When the sample starts, the map contains a set of bookmarks. You can select a bookmark from the list, which changes the map's viewpoint. To create a new bookmark, pan and zoom to a new location and select the + button. A prompt appears to let you provide a name for the new bookmark. When you select Done the new bookmark is added to the bookmark list.
